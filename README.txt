# WinUtil+
A little trash GDI trojan.

# Do not use this code for malicious purposes, or you will be in the jail for a long time.

# This source is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

# Do NOT try to build your own WinUtil+ to prank your friends. THIS APPLICATION IS NOT A PRANK!!!

### The "Dev Mode" is not added in source code, and code is edited so LogonUI.exe will not be destroyed if you build it yourself.
